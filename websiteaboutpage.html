            <p>This website is show casing my design and photography work from NCEA Level 3 2017. My brief for design was a campaign about encouraging people to spend less time on technology, in particular children, teenagers and young adults. I chose a bold colour palette that is present throughout my work in order to catch the attention of those looking down at their screens constantly. I wanted to promote my campaign entirely avoiding digital marketing as my campaign was about spending less time on technology. My idea for photography looked at sound vibrations and how we can convey that through images. I worked a lot with bold color against black to create a strong contrast in particular when fabricating images and when working with projecting light materials into the air using sound vibrations. </p>
            
            <p>This is the brief that I based my deisgn work on;    The New Zealand Education Department in conjunction with the Health Department are concerned about the amount of time children, teenagers and young adults in this day and age are spending on Computer screens and in particular, hand-held devices. They plan to launch a campaign called ‘offline’ which will promote a controlled use of technology. The aim of the campaign is to encourage young people to spend at least three hours a day without their phones, computers, iPads and other devices. They wish to encourage sports, outdoor activities, and to further social interaction between peers. You are a freelance designer contacted to promote the campaign ‘offline’.</p>
            
            <p>My Photography work looks into portraying sound vibrations through imagery. My work was shot all in studio and was heavily photoshop, as well as some images were fabricated from other images. The whole collection of images looks at showing the process of sounds throughout my work. I did this by introducing musical instruments through the beginning of my work then evolving to more abstract images and starting to be able to refine my work. Throughout my work I looked at working with images in series and different view points. </p>
